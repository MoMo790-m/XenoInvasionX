# XenoInvasionX ðŸ‘¾

Hey there! Welcome to **XenoInvasionX**, a fun little 2D space shooter made with Python and Pygame. This project is actually inspired by my journey into programming, and I wanna share a bit of that story before diving into the game itself.

## How It All Started  

So, I **love reading**, and thatâ€™s exactly how I got into coding. I started with the book  
***"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes***, and honestly, it was a game changer for me.  

It gave me both **theory and hands-on practice** in Python, making concepts **way easier to understand**. The book covers everything from basic Python syntax to **lists, OOP, and when to use what**â€”all in a structured way.  

The game **XenoInvasionX** is actually one of the projects in the book! I followed along, coded it, and learned so much about **organizing code, working with objects, handling game logic, and more**.  

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re starting with Python, I **highly recommend** this book! Itâ€™ll seriously help you get a strong foundation.

## About the Game  

**XenoInvasionX** is a simple yet exciting **space shooter** where you control a spaceship and take down waves of alien invaders. The goal? **Survive and score as high as possible!** 

This game is a **classic "Space Invaders"-style shooter**. Hereâ€™s what it includes:  

- **Multiple levels** with increasing difficulty and a scoring system.  
- **Sound effects and background music** using `pygame.mixer`.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to manage game objects like the ship, bullets, and aliens.  
- **A simple user interface**, including a **"PRESS ENTER"** button to start the game and a **"GAME OVER"** screen when you lose.  
- **A high-score system** that saves the best score in a text file.  

I've also made some modifications to improve the gameâ€™s visuals:  

- Redesigned the **ship, aliens, and bullets** to look better.  
- Updated the **background** for a more immersive feel.  
- Planning to add **more sound effects** soon to enhance the overall experience. 

### How to Play  
- **Move** â†’ Arrow keys  
- **Shoot** â†’ Spacebar  
- **Destroy aliens** and keep going!    

**Hope you like it! More importantly, have fun learning and keep making progress**.
